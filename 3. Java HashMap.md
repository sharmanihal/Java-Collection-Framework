### Java HashMap 

Java HashMap is a hash table-based implementation of Javaâ€™s Map interface. A Map, as you might know, is a collection of key-value pairs. It maps keys to values.

**Following are a few key points to note about HashMaps in Java -**

1. A HashMap cannot contain duplicate keys.
2. Java HashMap allows null values and the null key.
3. HashMap is an unordered collection. It does not guarantee any specific order of the elements.
4. Java HashMap is not thread-safe. You must explicitly synchronize concurrent modifications to the HashMap.

### Creating a HashMap and Adding key-value pairs to it

```
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.HashMap;
class CreateHashMapExample{
  public static void main(String args[]){
        // Creating a HashMap
        Map<String, Integer> numberMapping = new HashMap<>();

        // Adding key-value pairs to a HashMap
        numberMapping.put("One", 1);
        numberMapping.put("Two", 2);
        numberMapping.put("Three", 3);

        // Add a new key-value pair only if the key does not exist in the HashMap, or is mapped to `null`
        numberMapping.putIfAbsent("Four", 4);

        System.out.println(numberMapping);

  }
}
```

### Accessing keys and modifying their associated value in a HashMap
**The example below shows:**
1. How to check if a HashMap is empty | isEmpty()
2. How to find the size of a HashMap | size()
3. How to check if a given key exists in a HashMap | containsKey()
4. How to check if a given value exists in a HashMap | containsValue()
5. How to get the value associated with a given key in the HashMap | get()
6. How to modify the value associated with a given key in the HashMap | put()

```
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.HashMap;
class CreateHashMapExample{
  public static void main(String args[]){
        Map<String, String> userCityMapping = new HashMap<>();

        // Check if a HashMap is empty
        System.out.println("is userCityMapping empty? : " + userCityMapping.isEmpty());

        userCityMapping.put("John", "New York");
        userCityMapping.put("Rajeev", "Bengaluru");
        userCityMapping.put("Steve", "London");

        System.out.println("userCityMapping HashMap : " + userCityMapping);

        // Find the size of a HashMap
        System.out.println("We have the city information of " + userCityMapping.size() + " users");

        String userName = "Steve";
        // Check if a key exists in the HashMap
        if(userCityMapping.containsKey(userName)) {
            // Get the value assigned to a given key in the HashMap
            String city = userCityMapping.get(userName);
            System.out.println(userName + " lives in " + city);
        } else {
            System.out.println("City details not found for user " + userName);
        }

        // Check if a value exists in a HashMap
        if(userCityMapping.containsValue("New York")) {
            System.out.println("There is a user in the userCityMapping who lives in New York");
        } else {
            System.out.println("There is no user in the userCityMapping who lives in New York");
        }


        // Modify the value assigned to an existing key
        userCityMapping.put(userName, "California");
        System.out.println(userName + " moved to a new city " + userCityMapping.get(userName) + ", New userCityMapping : " + userCityMapping);

        // The get() method returns `null` if the specified key was not found in the HashMap
        System.out.println("Lisa's city : " + userCityMapping.get("Lisa"));
  }
}
```

### Removing keys from a HashMap
**The following example shows how to :**

1. Remove a key from a HashMap | remove(Object key)
2. Remove a key from a HashMap only if it is associated with a given value | remove(Object key, Object value)

```
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.HashMap;
class CreateHashMapExample{
  public static void main(String args[]){
        Map<String, String> husbandWifeMapping = new HashMap<>();
        husbandWifeMapping.put("Jack", "Marie");
        husbandWifeMapping.put("Chris", "Lisa");
        husbandWifeMapping.put("Steve", "Jennifer");

        System.out.println("Husband-Wife Mapping : " + husbandWifeMapping);

        // Remove a key from the HashMap
        // Ex - Unfortunately, Chris got divorced. Let's remove him from the mapping
        String husband = "Chris";
        String wife = husbandWifeMapping.remove(husband);

        System.out.println("Couple (" + husband + " => " + wife + ") got divorced");
        System.out.println("New Mapping : " + husbandWifeMapping);

        // Remove a key from the HashMap only if it is mapped to the given value
        // Ex - Divorce "Jack" only if He is married to "Linda"
        boolean isRemoved = husbandWifeMapping.remove("Jack", "Linda");
        System.out.println("Did Jack get removed from the mapping? : " + isRemoved);

        // remove() returns null if the mapping was not found for the supplied key
        wife = husbandWifeMapping.remove("David");
        if(wife == null) {
            System.out.println("Looks like David is not married to anyone");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Removed David and his wife from the mapping");
        }
  }
}
```


### Obtaining the entrySet, keySet, and values from a HashMap
**The Map interface provides methods to retrieve the set of entries (key-value pairs), the set of keys, and the collection of values.**

**The following example shows how to retrieve them from a HashMap -**
