### Java Queue

A Queue is a First In First Out (FIFO) data structure. It models a queue in real-life. Yes, the one that you might have seen in front of a movie theater, a shopping mall, a metro, or a bus.

Just like queues in real life, new elements in a Queue data structure are added at the back and removed from the front. A Queue can be visualized as shown in the figure below.

The process of adding an element at the back of the Queue is called Enqueue, and the process of removing an element from the front of the Queue is called Dequeue.

A Queue in Java is just an interface. We need a concrete implementation of the Queue interface to work with, in our programs.

As shown in the diagram above, the LinkedList class implements the Queue interface and therefore it can be used as a Queue.

### Creating a Queue and Performing basic operations like Enqueue and Dequeue

```
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class QueueExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create and initialize a Queue using a LinkedList
        Queue<String> waitingQueue = new LinkedList<>();

        // Adding new elements to the Queue (The Enqueue operation)
        waitingQueue.add("Rajeev");
        waitingQueue.add("Chris");
        waitingQueue.add("John");
        waitingQueue.add("Mark");
        waitingQueue.add("Steven");

        System.out.println("WaitingQueue : " + waitingQueue);

        // Removing an element from the Queue using remove() (The Dequeue operation)
        // The remove() method throws NoSuchElementException if the Queue is empty
        String name = waitingQueue.remove();
        System.out.println("Removed from WaitingQueue : " + name + " | New WaitingQueue : " + waitingQueue);

        // Removing an element from the Queue using poll()
        // The poll() method is similar to remove() except that it returns null if the Queue is empty.
        name = waitingQueue.poll();
        System.out.println("Removed from WaitingQueue : " + name + " | New WaitingQueue : " + waitingQueue);
    }
}
```


### Peek inside the Queue

1. Check if a Queue is empty.
2. Find the size of a Queue.
3. Search for an element in a Queue.
4. Get the element at the front of the Queue without removing it.

```
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class QueueSizeSearchFrontExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Queue<String> waitingQueue = new LinkedList<>();

        waitingQueue.add("Jennifer");
        waitingQueue.add("Angelina");
        waitingQueue.add("Johnny");
        waitingQueue.add("Sachin");

        System.out.println("WaitingQueue : " + waitingQueue);

        // Check if a Queue is empty
        System.out.println("is waitingQueue empty? : " + waitingQueue.isEmpty());

        // Find the size of the Queue
        System.out.println("Size of waitingQueue : " + waitingQueue.size());

        // Check if the Queue contains an element
        String name = "Johnny";
        if(waitingQueue.contains(name)) {
            System.out.println("WaitingQueue contains " + name);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Waiting Queue doesn't contain " + name);
        }

        // Get the element at the front of the Queue without removing it using element()
        // The element() method throws NoSuchElementException if the Queue is empty
        String firstPersonInTheWaitingQueue =  waitingQueue.element();
        System.out.println("First Person in the Waiting Queue (element()) : " + firstPersonInTheWaitingQueue);

        // Get the element at the front of the Queue without removing it using peek()
        // The peek() method is similar to element() except that it returns null if the Queue is empty
        firstPersonInTheWaitingQueue = waitingQueue.peek();
        System.out.println("First Person in the Waiting Queue : " + firstPersonInTheWaitingQueue);

    }
}
```
